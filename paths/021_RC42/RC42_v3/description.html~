<p>We've completely rewritten the application to be more flexible, and more secure! This time, the key is not present in the address space at all.</p>

<p>The new version is able to compress any byte stream, without length limitation.
To achieve this, we've created a new, standard input/output based interface for the program and made it available through TCP.
After some buffering, the received bytes are encrypted and sent back to the client.</p>

<p>It's very simple to use! We recommend using socat for communicating with the server. For example, encryption a whole file looks like this:</p>

<code><pre>$ cat /tmp/file | socat TCP4:10.1.1.1:8888 STDIO | xxd
0000000: 4558 414d 504c 450a 4558 414d 504c 450a  EXAMPLE.EXAMPLE.
0000010: 4558 414d 504c 450a 4558 414d 504c 450a  EXAMPLE.EXAMPLE.
0000020: 4558 414d 504c 450a 4558 414d 504c 450a  EXAMPLE.EXAMPLE.
</pre></code>
