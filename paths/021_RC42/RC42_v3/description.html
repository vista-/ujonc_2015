<p>We've completely rewritten the application to be more flexible, and more secure! This time, the key is not present in the address space at all.
To make thing even more secure, we require a license file to run the application.</p>

<p>The new version is able to encrypt any byte stream, without length limitation.
To achieve this, we've created a new, standard input/output based interface for the program and made it available through TCP.
After some buffering, the received bytes are encrypted and sent back to the client.</p>

<p>It's very simple to use! We recommend using <code>socat</code> for communicating with the server. For example, encrypting a whole file looks like this:</p>

<code><pre>$ cat /tmp/file | socat TCP4:10.1.1.1:8888 STDIO | xxd
0000000: 4558 414d 504c 450a 4558 414d 504c 450a  EXAMPLE.EXAMPLE.
0000010: 4558 414d 504c 450a 4558 414d 504c 450a  EXAMPLE.EXAMPLE.
0000020: 4558 414d 504c 450a 4558 414d 504c 450a  EXAMPLE.EXAMPLE.
</pre></code>
