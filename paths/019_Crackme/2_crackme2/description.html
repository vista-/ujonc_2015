<p>There is this awesome old game called Master of Adventures 4, that you really want to play, but it requires a serial number.
You would buy the game if you could, but the publisher has long disappeared, and there is no way to actually buy the game.</p>

<p>The only way is to somehow generate a serieal number based on the game binary.
To make this easier, a friend of yours extracted the actual serial number checking code into a
<a href="/blob/f400ec24-a880-4dea-b7b5-ecf606819589/crackme2">separate binary file that can be run on Linux</a>.
This file waits for a single command line argument, and exits with 0 code if the serial check was successful.
If it was not, it exits with a non-zero code.</p>
