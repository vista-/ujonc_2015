<p>There is this awesome old game called Master of Adventures 3, that you really want to play, but it requires a serial number.
You would buy the game if you could, but the publisher has long disappeared, and there is no way to actually buy the game.</p>

<p>The only way is to somehow generate a serial number based on the game binary.
To make this easier, a friend of yours extracted the actual serial number checking code into a
<a href="/blob/82aced6a-baa8-4380-a553-a14ca304283d/crackme1">separate binary file that can be run on Linux</a>.
This file waits for a single command line argument, and exits with 0 code if the serial check was successful.
If it was not, it exits with a non-zero code.</p>

<p>In a bash shell, it's easy to check the exit code. For example, you could do something like this:
<code><pre>$ ./crackme1 teszt123
$ echo $?
1
</code></pre>

<p>Or this:</p>
<code><pre>$ if ./crackme1 teszt123 ; then echo ':)' ; else echo ':(' ; fi
:(
</code></pre>

<p>To run it on a 64 bit Linux, you will need to install the 32 bit libc first. On Ubuntu, this is the libc6-i386 package.</p>

<p>The binary is stripped, and that means that you won't see the original function names.
The main function is usually easy to identify. In binaries compiled with GCC (like this one) the address of the main function
is passed as the first argument to the ___libc_start_main function near the entry point.</p>
