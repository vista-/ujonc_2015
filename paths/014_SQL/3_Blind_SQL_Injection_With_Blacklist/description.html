<p>Yeah, we were wrong when we thought that encryption would be a viable solution to our problem.</p>

<p>The solution we came up with this time is based on a proven technology: blacklisting.</p>

<p>It is as simple as powerful. We only had to add one line to implement it:</p>

<pre>$order = preg_replace('/CASE|WHEN|THEN|ELSE|END|SELECT/i', '', $order);</pre>
